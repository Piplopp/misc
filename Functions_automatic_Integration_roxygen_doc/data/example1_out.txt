For this example the "good" comment_symbol should be #'

#' @title A TITLE
#' @name A NAME
#' @thing
#' <TAG2INCLUDE>
#' \itemize{
#'	\item FUNCTIO NAME: FUNCTION DESC
#' }
#' <TAG2INCLUDE>
#' @export

#' @title FUNCTION DESC
#' @name FUNCTIO NAME
#' @export
some function
    indented
        and awesome code

# @title A THIRD TITLE THAT SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN BECAUSE WRONG COMMENT_SYMBOL
# @name A THIRD NAME THAT SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN BECAUSE WRONG COMMENT_SYMBOL
# @export

#' @title SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED BECAUSE NO export TAG
#' @name SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED BECAUSE NO export TAG
some other_function
    that is as wonderfull{
        as a cat riding a unicorn
    }

#' @title SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED BECAUSE NO export TAG
#' @name SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED BECAUSE NO export TAG
